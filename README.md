# Tic Tac Toe

## Summary
A fun little design side project on this simple game to get me started in animation. My husband Yanbin and I will collaborate to make it real.

Live version coming soon.

## Tools: 
* Pen & Paper (Sketches)
* Sketch (Wires, Visual) 
* Priciple (Animation)
* GIF Screen Capture (LICEcap)

## Define it!
*What is it?*
Tic Tac Toe, a well-known game.

*Who is it for?*
Anyone, really. The only thing that matters seems to be in the visual styles. I was thinking about making something very colorful, aka for kids, but ended up not going with that.

## Sketches
* * *
It's a very straightforward game, so I mainly spent some time sketching on layouts. I wanted to see if there's a layout that looks a bit different from what everyone else does. (e.g. Search "Tic Tac Toe" on Google, you'll find a classic version by Google)

## Wireframes
I put together two layouts. Both Yanbin and I preferred the second one, thinking it looks a bit more modern.

## Visual Explorations
I explored some typefaces and color palettes. Ended up not using any fancy typefaces but that's fine.

## Visualize it!
My first time with Principle! It turned out pretty good. Very simple tool for some simple animations -- I can see it works with more sophisticated animations as well.
